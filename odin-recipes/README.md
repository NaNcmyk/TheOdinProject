## Description

A list-acular recipe website of ghastly delectables--`<ul>`'s! `<ol>`'s! and `<li>`'s! Oh, my!--with a splash of ‚ú® CSS flexbox ‚ú® thrown in for good measure. And a few zero-calorie media queries for mobile responsiveness.

P.S. The homepage is on fire üî•üò≤. (If you can't handle the heat ü•µ, get out of the kitchen.)
